If you want to learn more about the features of CorelDRAW X8, here are some of the highlights:
 
- Split vector objects, text, and bitmaps with Enhanced Knife Tool. This tool lets you cut any object along a freehand, 2-point line, or BÃ©zier curve. You can also choose to overlap or gap the split objects, and apply an outline and fill to them.
- Enhanced Straighten Image dialog box to correct perspective distortions. This feature lets you adjust the perspective of a photo by dragging four corner points to match the shape of the object you want to straighten. You can also apply cropping and rotation to the image.
- Fix imperfections in photo subjects using the new Healing Clone tool. This tool lets you remove unwanted elements from a photo by painting over them with a sampled color or texture that matches the surrounding area. You can also adjust the size, feathering, and source offset of the tool.
- All new Gaussian Blur lens and the enhanced drop shadows. The Gaussian Blur lens lets you apply a non-destructive blur effect to any object or group of objects. You can adjust the radius and feathering of the blur, and apply it to a vector shape or a bitmap. The enhanced drop shadows let you add realistic shadows to objects with feathering, transparency, and color options.
- Create adjacent shapes with similar contours. This feature lets you create shapes that share a common edge, such as a map or a logo. You can use the Contour tool or the Blend tool to create smooth transitions between shapes.
- Group, view, filter and find fonts easily. The new Font Manager lets you manage your fonts more efficiently. You can create font collections and filter them by weight, width, style, or supported scripts. You can also view fonts in different sizes and colors, and find fonts quickly by typing keywords or font names.
